## Introduction:
  We have made a project centered around the theme education where we have tried to implement solutions which we feel can improve the way education is delivered online. We have tried to integrate hands on learning experience for the user.

## Education Mania :
Our Team "Day Night Coders" has made an Education Project named EducationMania.
It is a platform for students in the period of COVID-19 Panedamic.
It helps a lot to the students especially engineering students. Due to COVID-19, offline education systems are restricted.
More than 1 billion children are at risk of falling behind due to school closures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. To keep the world’s children learning, countries have been implementing remote education programmes. Yet many of the world’s children – particularly those in poorer households – do not have internet access, personal computers, TVs or even radio at home, amplifying the effects of existing learning inequalities. Students lacking access to the technologies needed for home-based learning have limited means to continue their education. As a result, many face the risk of never returning to school, undoing years of progress made in education around the world.
With school closures across 188 countries (as of April 2020), many of them are exploring alternative ways to provide continuous education using technologies such as Internet, TV, and radio. However, access to these technologies is limited in many low- and middle-income countries, especially among poor households.
### 
it is important that countries do not rely on any single remote learning channel to reach all children. Additionally, expanding access to Internet and other digital solutions for all children would be one key long-term priority to reduce learning vulnerabilities.
