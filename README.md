# Education-Project
Our Team "Day Night Coders has made an Education Projection named EducationMania.
Education Mania : It is a platform for students in the period of COVID-19 Panedamic.
It helps a lot to the students especially engineerings students. Due to COVID-19, education is restricted.
More than 1 billion children are at risk of falling behind due to school closures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. To keep the world’s children learning, countries have been implementing remote education programmes. Yet many of the world’s children – particularly those in poorer households – do not have internet access, personal computers, TVs or even radio at home, amplifying the effects of existing learning inequalities. Students lacking access to the technologies needed for home-based learning have limited means to continue their education. As a result, many face the risk of never returning to school, undoing years of progress made in education around the world.
